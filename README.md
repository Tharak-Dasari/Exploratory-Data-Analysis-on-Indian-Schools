# Methodology Employed 
It is common for a typical EDA project to involve certain sequential steps in order to conduct a thorough analysis and gain a better understanding of the data.They are:

*   Data collection from various sources and formats (e.g. CSV, Excel).
*   Data cleaning to remove inconsistencies and errors.
*   Data transformation to prepare the data for analysis.
*   Summarization of data using descriptive statistics (e.g. mean, median, standard deviation).
*   Visualization of data using techniques such as bar charts, scatter plots, and pie charts.
*   Analysis of insights gained from EDA to inform further analyses and modeling.
*   Asking and answering interesting questions related to the data to uncover hidden insights and potential correlations.
*   Summarizing the inferences drawn from the analysis and drawing appropriate conclusions based on the results obtained.

## 1.My Dataset

The dataset used for this exploratory data analysis project was obtained from [Kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kuchhbhi/schoolsinindia). It includes information on approximately 800,000 **Indian schools,** covering various details such as school name, address, instruction medium, management, demographics and more. It is important to note that the exact time when these details were collected from the source is unknown, but for the purpose of this analysis, we assume they represent the school information as of the year 2021.

## 2.Data Cleaning and Preperation
In order to conduct meaningful data analysis, it is crucial to ensure that the data is clean and properly formatted. This involves loading the data using a library such as Pandas, observing the data to identify potential issues or inconsistencies, and then addressing any missing or incorrect values through techniques such as data imputation or removal of erroneous observations. By taking these steps, we can prepare the data for further analysis and visualization, ensuring that the results are reliable and accurate.

## 3.Exploratory Analysis and Visualization
Now that we have a cleaned dataset of schools in India, we can start exploring and analyzing the data to gain insights. We can focus on various columns such as **state, gender distribution of teachers, medium of instruction, year of establishment**, and more. By analyzing these columns, we can understand the distribution of schools across different states in India, the gender diversity in teaching staff, the popularity of different mediums of instruction, and how the number of schools has evolved over the years. We can also create visualizations like **bar charts, histograms, and scatterplots** to make the analysis more intuitive and easier to understand. Through these exploratory analyses, we can uncover hidden patterns and trends that can inform further decision-making and research in the field of education.

## 4.Ask and Answer Questions
1. What is the gender distribution among teachers in Indian Schools?
2. How are different managements/ownerships of the schools distributed in india?
3. What is the condition of electricity availability in Indian schools?
4. Is there a correlation between the availability of electricity and computer-aided learning in schools?
5. Which state has the highest percentage of schools with access to safe drinking water?
6. How does the distribution of school types vary between rural and urban areas?
7.  What is the correlation between the establishment year and the availability of basic amenities such as drinking water, electricity, and libraries?
8. What is the average number of classrooms per school, and how does this vary by school type?

## 5.Interactive Graphs
Interactive graphs play a vital role in data analysis projects as they enhance the visual representation of information and allow users to explore and interact with the data dynamically. These graphs provide a dynamic and engaging way to present complex data sets, enabling users to drill down into specific details, filter data based on various criteria, and gain deeper insights. By providing interactive elements such as tooltips, zooming, panning, and filtering options, these graphs empower analysts and stakeholders to discover patterns, trends, and correlations that might otherwise go unnoticed.

## 6.Summary and Conclusions
Based on the exploratory analysis we have done on the schools of India, here are the key findings and conclusions:

**General Points:**
   - Madhya Pradesh, West Bengal and Bihar have the highest number of schools, while smaller states like Sikkim and Tripura have fewer schools.
   - 83% of indian schools belang to Rural areas.
   - IN 2006, 25770 new schools have been eastablihed in india making it the year with hieiest school eastablishemnts.
   - Almost 56% of schools are managed by 'Depart of Education'(State Governments)
   -Chandighar has 100% schools with safe drinking water
   - Density of schools per area in delhi is **3**. (Nearly 3 schools/Sq.KM)

**Concerning Points**
   - The availability of electricity in schools is not very great, with around 62% of schools having electricity.
   - Only 21.3% of schools with electricity have computer-aided learning.
   - The state of Kerala, despite its high literacy rate, has a lower percentage of schools with access to safe drinking water.
